# Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2025 AI-Generated Interview Video

## Project Overview
This project comprises a 5- to 6-minute AI-generated video interview about the 2025 Syracuse University women's lacrosse season.   The video depicts a lively conversation between an interviewer and an expert, highlighting key performance insights, player contributions, coaching influences, and strategic outlooks, all while leveraging extensive individual and team information.

Using AI video generation technologies, the interview script was constructed from official season data and converted into a realistic video.

## Features
- A comprehensive season overview, including reliable data and commentary.
- Finding the greatest players and key contributors on both the offensive and defensive sides
- Strategic thoughts on team development and coaching.
- A cinematic video aesthetic that works well for presentations demonstrating sports analytics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Installing software is not required because the movie was created using online AI technology (Invideo AI)
- This repository (or its link) provides access to the created video file.

## Project Structure
/video/ # Contains the AI-generated interview video file
/scripts/ # Contains the interview script text files
/readme.md # This README file

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Invideo AI (https://ai.invideo.io) is used to generate AI videos.
- Official statistics from Syracuse University Athletics are the source of the data.
- Writing scripts using a language model based on Perplexity

## How the Video was Created
1. Player and team data from the Syracuse Women's Lacrosse season of 2025 were analyzed.
2. A detailed interview script was developed to provide factual, analytical, and strategic insights.
3. Invideo AI used the script to generate human-like speech and avatars.
4. Natural avatar actions and delicate camera movements were used for cinematic effects.
5. The completed video was saved and exported for sharing and presenting.

## Approach
There are 3 things that are needed in order to complete this task
1. Analyses from previous tasks (Input)
2. Story Script (Input)
3. Any free AI tool (Output)

In order to create a narrative, the analyses from previous tasks were taken, in my case, the analyses from more than one LLM model, ChatGPT, Perplexity and Claude, and were fed into Perplexity AI. You can choose any AI tool you want. After feeding the analyses to the AI assistant it was then asked to create a story in such a way that the conversation should flow in a very smooth manner.

Once the script was ready, Invideo AI was opted as a prompt to speech video generation tool, the reason this tool was chosen because first, it is an absolutely free tool to use and second, one can generate upto 45 minutes of video for any platfrom and in any aspect ratio. In the process, other AI video generation tools were tested, it was observed that those tools had only single avatars and were not a best choice to deep fake an interview. Kling AI, Midjourney AI, Synthesia AI were few of the tools which were tested and failed for this particular use case.

A prompt was designed which was used as an input to Invideo AI to generate video. The prompt is provided in the other section below. After the prompt was provided the tool took around 15 to 20 minutes to convert and render a video of around 5 minutes. The output in itself not very up to the mark but it did a great job than other Video AI tools in the list. So basically, Invideo AI uses all the stock videos and images from its repository to generate a video. Though the 'Street' style interview with a deep fake was not achieved in the video format but the audio used in it was very as per the prompt and instructions provided.


## Prompt

Create a realistic 3 to 4 minute conversational interview video between two avatars: an Interviewer and an Expert.

The setting is a modern sports studio with clean, neutral background, soft professional lighting, and a dynamic camera that slowly zooms in or cuts between the two avatars as they speak.

The Interviewer speaks in a clear, friendly, engaging tone, asking the following questions in segments with short natural pauses between each:

Welcome to our in-depth look at the Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2025 season. To kick things off, how many games did the team play and how was their overall performance?

Who led the team in scoring this season, and what factors made her stand out?

Which players contributed notably through assists and how did they impact team offense?

Can you tell us about the key defensive players and their roles?

Were there players with remarkable shooting efficiency despite fewer shots?

How did the new coaching staff influence the team dynamics and strategy?

What challenges remain, particularly in late-game play?

What recruiting focus areas should the team consider moving forward?

Lastly, what message would you give fans and players looking ahead to the next season?

The Expert responds in a calm, confident, and professional tone with detailed answers reflecting the following points:

The team played 19 games with a strong overall presence, scoring 235 goals against opponents’ 221.

Emma Muchnick led with 34 goals, with consistent scoring and nearly 48% shooting accuracy.

Emma Ward led assists with 46 and total points at 76, while Caroline Trinkaus showed great scoring and assisting balance.

Coco Vandiver excelled defensively with ground balls and caused turnovers; Alexa Vogelman contributed across offense and defense.

Mackenzie Rich had perfect accuracy with 1 goal from 1 shot; Olivia Adamson was also efficient.

Head coach Regy Thorpe and assistant Nicole Levy brought championship experience and offensive expertise.

The biggest challenge is improving fourth-quarter defense through endurance and possession.

Recruiting should focus on defensive midfielders skilled in draw controls and stamina.

The future is bright with dedicated players and coaches committed to growth and success.

Instructions:

Maintain natural conversational pacing with brief pauses between Q&A.

Use subtle camera zoom or angle shifts to emphasize speaker changes.

The avatars should use body language and facial expressions appropriate for a professional interview.

The video style should be polished and cinematic, suitable for a sports interview show.

End the video with a smooth fade-out after the last answer.
